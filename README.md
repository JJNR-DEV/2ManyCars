# 2ManyCars

Car share service (MVP)

## Origin

The project started as an idea to explore the framework Bootstrap during the beginning of my learning of web development. The idea was a single page website for a company that would provide a car sharing service in where the user could either offer a ride for a value, or the user coud look up for a ride.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to practice Typescript in the creation of a full stack MVP application, currently in development stage picking up the original concept and creating a more structure concept.
